# IC (集成电路)



**IC**(集成电路) is short for **Integrated Circuit** or **Integrated Chip**.<br/>

IC may refer to any of the following:



+ Alternatively referred to as a bare chip (裸芯片), monolithic integrated circuit (单片集成电路), or microchip (微芯片). The IC is a package containing many circuits, logic gates (逻辑门), pathways (路径), transistors (晶体管), and other components all working together to perform a particular function or a series of functions. Integrated circuits are the building blocks of computer hardware.

The picture shows an example of several integrated circuits. Because the IC is fragile, it's often encased in a plastic package with metal pins extending out of it to connect to a circuit board. An IC may be packaged as SIP (single in-line package), DIP (dual in-line package), PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), or another type.<br/>

&ensp;**Integrated circuit generations**

Since their creation, there have been many different generations of integrated circuits with increases to the number of transistors and logic gates per chip. Below is a list of each of the generations and the approximate capacity of each chip.

	+ SSI (small-scale integration) - 1 to 10 transistors and 1 to 12 logic gates.

	+ MSI (medium-scale integration) - 10 to 500 transistors and 13 to 99 logic gates.

	+ LSI (large-scale integration) - 500 to 20,000 transistors and 100 to 9,999 logic gates.

	+ VLSI (very-large-scale integration) - 20,000 to 1,000,000 transistors and 10,000 to 99,999 logic gates.

	+ ULSI (ultra-large-scale integration) - over 1,000,000 transistors and 100,000 logic gates.
