# PCB(印刷电路板)

**PCB** is short for **Printed Circuit Board** and was invented by Paul Eisler while working on a radio in 1936. Sometimes abbreviated as a **board**. A PCB is made of plastic or fiberglass that holds [ICs](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/ic.htm) and other components. A good example of a PCB found in all computers today is the computer [motherboard](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mothboar.htm). The circuit board is most often green from the [solder](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/solder.htm) mask that coats the board, however, can be any other color, including red, blue, and even black.The picture is close-up of a printed circuit board. The picture below is a circuit board from a Wacom tablet. In the bottom right portion of this board are some ICs that give the board its brains.







## What is the biggest circuit board in a computer?



In a desktop computer, the [motherboard](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/mothboar.htm) is the largest circuit board that all other boards and devices connect to and communicate with each other.



## What are the boards that connect to a motherboard?



In a desktop computer, [expansion cards](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/expacard.htm) can be added to a computer to upgrade an existing component (e.g., a [video card](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/video-card.htm)) or add new functionality to a computer.
