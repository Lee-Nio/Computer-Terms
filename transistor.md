# Transistor (晶体管)



Developed was at the Bell Laboratories on December 23. **Transistor** is short for "transfer resistance". The **transistor** is made up of [semiconductors](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/semicond.htm "半导体"). It is a component used to control the amount of current (电流) or voltage (电压) or used for amplification/modulation or switching of an electronic signal (电子信号的放大/调制或切换). The picture shows several examples of transistors. ![Transistors](https://www.computerhope.com/cdn/transistors.jpg "Transistors")<br/><br/>

The transistor is the primary building block of all microchips, including your CPU. It is what creates the binary 0's and 1's (bits) your computer uses to communicate and deal with Boolean logic.When placed in different configurations, transistors form logic gates, which can be combined into arrays called [half adders](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/adder.htm "half adders") that can also be combined into full adders.
